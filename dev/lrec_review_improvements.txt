Me :

how do we add about the creation of multi-lingual dictionary creation of urdu sindhi hindi ?
- dictionary helped in inducing some morph features while creating morph-analyser.. features such as lexical category and gender.

In other places, facts are listed without pointing out their relevance to your
work and drawing conclusions.

There are repeated formatting errors and figures are hard to read and miss
explanations/references.

Abstract:


1: "These words a constructed by combining smaller meaning-bearing units,
called morphemes. A morphological
analysis of a word involves describing one or more of its properties such as:
gender, number, person, case, lexical
category, etc. The properties are captured by the morpheme(s) that a word is
composed of."
=> if you want to cite a general definition of morphology/morphemes it should
be exact, there are free morphemes that do not describe the properties
mentioned by you to which bound morphemes are attached etc. This should be
shortened in favor of a to give a morphological description of Sindhi more
space.


if you give so much background on the conditions and history of Sindhi you
should draw conclusions from it i.e. the demand for language technological
tools etc.

<spectei> this is a good idea

"Adjectives have three degrees for comparison, positive,
comparative which are expressed analytically. "
=> should be: Adjectives have three degrees for comparison, analytical positive
and
comparative (e.g. ...) and superlative (e.g. ...) which are expressed
analytically.

2.3.1:
"We have not completely added all the forms in our
lexicon. Some such uncovered forms are various moods,
some forms of tenses (conditional, perfect, participles , habitual,
indefinite), causative forms, etc. We have covered
some verbs form of auxiliaries, transitive and intransitive
verbs."
=> here you suddenly mix the description of the language and structure of your
analyser, stay consistent! Also if you mention that not all forms are covered,
what is the percentage of covered verbs, how many entries are there etc.? A
reference to table 2?
=> "verb forms"

<spectei> this is a good idea
<spectei> we need to be explicit about what we cover and what we don't cover

"Transitive verbs are ones that require an object. It can also
be seen as they ( verbs ) are transferring their action to an
object. ... Intransitive verbs, on the contrary, do not need an object."
=> again this is an (unnecessary) definition while you it is relevant which
kind of verbs Sindhi includes. Are there just transitive and intransitive verbs
or also e.g. ditransitive verbs? How is that distinction relevant to your
morphological analyser?

<spectei> we can say that the distinction is important for morphological disambiguation and parsing as the transitivity of the verb determines the subject case in certain tenses 

2.4:
"Adjuncts amplify part of a sentence. They generally do not
inflect. Its five main types are: adverbs, particles, postposition,
conjunction and interjections."
=> adjuncts refer to a syntactic category, not a PoS category.. Again it is a
general definition ..

<spectei> do not call these adjuncts
<spectei> maybe something like "the remaining parts of speech are uninflecting closed categories, these include: "


3:

"We had referred this library during initial
stages of our work and we had also found and reported
some mistakes in it. For instance, some feminine nouns
were assigned to a paradigm for masculine nouns." => this belongs into a
technical report, not in your individual research
The section should be cut down focusing on the work you are going to use for
your own research

4: sounds like a technical report describing the steps and progress of your
work rather than relevant information to the reader, e.g. how many twolc rules
does your analyzer include, what was the quality of the Wikipedia texts
(coverage of forms etc.), 

<spectei> we should say the number of paradigms somewhere

Figure 2: The subtext should be included in running text rather than being below the figure to improve
readability.

Figure 1: Why is figure 1 placed after figure 2, the functionality of the
lexicon entry in figure 1 should either be described to the reader or left out.

Figure 3: the subline of the figure should be
part of the text for better readability. Also an explanation of it is missing,
i.e. what do you want to illustrate with it? Since you disambiguated it
manually, it does not show the morphological analyser's ability to give various
analyses, so what do you want to illustrate?

5.1: 

1-4 is a technical report style which it should not, instead of a temporal
structure of the work process, the results, challenges, should be ordered by
linguistic/technical criteria


5.2. "more recent version of the analyser" => which version number or date?
reproducability of results

"The list is publicaly available for each
language in Apertiumâ€™s SVN repository"
=> link or name of the list


5.3 
"There are quite a few reason that we think why our analyser
make the mistakes that it did."
=> what is the evidence for you thinking that?

<spectei> yeah, we should mention this
