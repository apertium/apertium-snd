In other places, facts are listed without pointing out their relevance to your
work and drawing conclusions.

There are repeated formatting errors and figures are hard to read and miss
explanations/references.

Abstract:
"which helps in other NLP applications" => "is used"

1: "These words a constructed by combining smaller meaning-bearing units,
called morphemes. A morphological
analysis of a word involves describing one or more of its properties such as:
gender, number, person, case, lexical
category, etc. The properties are captured by the morpheme(s) that a word is
composed of."
=> if you want to cite a general definition of morphology/morphemes it should
be exact, there are free morphemes that do not describe the properties
mentioned by you to which bound morphemes are attached etc. This should be
shortened in favor of a to give a morphological description of Sindhi more
space.

"fairly inflectional morphology" => what does "fairly inclectional" mean? Which
parts of the morphology are less inflectional and does it mean they are  e.g.
agglutinative or something else in other parts?

"The paper is organised in the following manner. We give
an overview of the language in Section 2. and discuss the
work done previously on it in Section 3.. We describe our
developmental process in Section 4., followed by our evaluation
in Section 5., future work in Section 6. and concluding
remarks in Section 7.."
 => The paper is organised in the following manner. We give
an overview of the language in Section 2 and discuss the
work done previously on it in Section 3. We describe our
developmental process in Section 4, followed by our evaluation
in Section 5, future work in Section 6 and concluding
remarks in Section 7.

2: the headline could give more information about the content, e.g.
morphological properties of Sindhi, linguistic features of Sindhi etc.

if you give so much background on the conditions and history of Sindhi you
should draw conclusions from it i.e. the demand for language technological
tools etc.

"the vocabulary is contains many loan words from Persian, Arabic,
Hindi and Urdu."
=> the vocabulary contains many ...

2.1: "Currently, both Devanagari and Perso-Arabic are official
forms of writing Sindhi in India, while in Pakistan the only
official form is Perso-Arabic. In our work we use only the
Perso-Arabic script." => Is that to reach more people with your tools? What are
the reasons for this choice?

"The Sindhi alphabet in Perso-Arabic is a variant of Persian
alphabet."
=> ... of the Persian...

2.2: "As mentioned earlier, Sindhi has a very rich morphology." => where have
you mentioned that earlier?

2.3.: I am missing a paradigm here to show the morpheme structure. You
mentioned the paradigm-based approach in the abstract, still you haven't shown
any paradigm in your paper.

"Adjectives have three degrees for comparison, positive,
comparative which are expressed analytically. "
=> should be: Adjectives have three degrees for comparison, analytical positive
and
comparative (e.g. ...) and superlative (e.g. ...) which are expressed
analytically.

2.3.1:
"We have not completely added all the forms in our
lexicon. Some such uncovered forms are various moods,
some forms of tenses (conditional, perfect, participles , habitual,
indefinite), causative forms, etc. We have covered
some verbs form of auxiliaries, transitive and intransitive
verbs."
=> here you suddenly mix the description of the language and structure of your
analyser, stay consistent! Also if you mention that not all forms are covered,
what is the percentage of covered verbs, how many entries are there etc.? A
reference to table 2?
=> "verb forms"

"Transitive verbs are ones that require an object. It can also
be seen as they ( verbs ) are transferring their action to an
object. ... Intransitive verbs, on the contrary, do not need an object."
=> again this is an (unnecessary) definition while you it is relevant which
kind of verbs Sindhi includes. Are there just transitive and intransitive verbs
or also e.g. ditransitive verbs? How is that distinction relevant to your
morphological analyser?

2.4:
"Adjuncts amplify part of a sentence. They generally do not
inflect. Its five main types are: adverbs, particles, postposition,
conjunction and interjections."
=> adjuncts refer to a syntactic category, not a PoS category.. Again it is a
general definition ..

3:
"Some of these are: Tamil by Parameswari
(2010), Assamese by Rahman and Sarma (2015), Oriya by
Jena et al. (2011), Malayalam by Rinju et al. (2013) and
Vinod et al. (2012)."
 => Those developed for other Indo-Aryan languages are: Tamil by Parameswari
(2010), Assamese by Rahman and Sarma (2015), Oriya by
Jena et al. (2011), Malayalam by Rinju et al. (2013) and
Vinod et al. (2012).

"Grammatical Framework Ranta (2009)" => Grammatical Framework (Ranta 2009)

"We had referred this library during initial
stages of our work and we had also found and reported
some mistakes in it. For instance, some feminine nouns
were assigned to a paradigm for masculine nouns." => this belongs into a
technical report, not in your individual research
The section should be cut down focusing on the work you are going to use for
your own research

4: sounds like a technical report describing the steps and progress of your
work rather than relevant information to the reader, e.g. how many twolc rules
does your analyzer include, what was the quality of the Wikipedia texts
(coverage of forms etc.), which version of Wikipedia has been used
what is relevant: "it was a manual process,
grammar books 45 => the footnote looks like 45, put the websites into one
footnote "url1 and url2"

Figure 2: you do not refer to the figure in the text. The subtext should be
included in running text rather than being below the figure to improve
readability.

Figure 1: Why is figure 1 placed after figure 2, the functionality of the
lexicon entry in figure 1 should either be described to the reader or left out.

Figure 3: is not referred to in the text, the subline of the figure should be
part of the text for better readability. Also an explanation of it is missing,
i.e. what do you want to illustrate with it? Since you disambiguated it
manually, it does not show the morphological analyser's ability to give various
analyses, so what do you want to illustrate?

5.1: punctuation:
There are a lot of websites, books, blogs, etc. on the internet
, =>
There are a lot of websites, books, blogs, etc. on the internet,

footnote 6 and 7 could be summarized, also they should include information
about the version, i.e. date (not just "recent")
steps 1-4 should be summarized to give the result as they sound like a
technical report

5.1.1.
footnote 6 and 7: leave out footnote 6 as it is almost the same as 7

"We
downloaded a recent Sindhi Wikipedia dump7 and created
our corpus in the following manner". => which version did you download, date?

1-4 is a technical report style which it should not, instead of a temporal
structure of the work process, the results, challenges, should be ordered by
linguistic/technical criteria

xml.bz2 file => if you refer to a specific file, make sure it is available to
the reader

5.2. "more recent version of the analyser" => which version number or date?
reproducability of results

"The list is publicaly available for each
language in Apertium’s SVN repository"
=> link or name of the list
=> "publicly"

which of the previously mentioned corpora did you use to calculate precision
and recall? "a Wikipedia corpus", is that the corpus mentioned in 5.1.1? Did
you use the corpus in 5.1.2 at all?

How is that reflected in table 4??

5.3 "Qualitative" => "Qualitative evaluation"
"There are quite a few reason that we think why our analyser
make the mistakes that it did."
=> what is the evidence for you thinking that?
=> analyser made the mistakes

"for example the suffix ءَ [ə] comes
with some nouns and proper nouns in oblique cases it was
not there in the paradigms."
=> for example the suffix ءَ [ə] that is attached to
 some nouns and proper nouns in oblique cases was missing in the paradigms.

6:
"Another plan that we have is to develop rule-based machine
translation systems in Apertium for Sindhi. We already
have a Urdu-Hindi MT system in Apertium and since
these languages are closely related and share common linguistic
properties, we can use them to develop MT systems
for Urdu–Sindhi and Sindhi–Hindi language pairs."
=> an Urdu-Hindi MT ...
=> you should relate that to the morphological analyser and the work you have
done

7:
"The lexicon is entirely encoded in Unicode and has
reasonable coverage with few lexical entries."
=>  "The lexicon is entirely encoded in Unicode and has
reasonable coverage for few lexical entries."

References:
you should be consistent with capitalisation of proper names within the titles:
while they are capitalized in "Rule based part of
speech tagging of Sindhi language." they are not in e.g "An improvized
morphological analyzer
cum generator for tamil: A case of implementing
the open source platform apertium." (tamil => Tamil) and "Morphological
analyzer for malayalam: Probabilistic method vs rule
based method." (malayalam => Malayalam)
